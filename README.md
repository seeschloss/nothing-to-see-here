# nothing-to-see-here
Move along.

## Installation ##
Using git:
    $ git clone https://github.com/seeschloss/nothing-to-see-here.git

Using npm:
    $ npm install nothing-to-see-here

## Usage ##

    var nothing = require('nothing-to-see-here');
    // Do nothing with nothing, since it does nothing at all.

## Why ##
I'd like to see what percentage of package downloads on npmjs.org are entirely automated downloads rather than genuine usage.
Hopefully, a package which does nothing will not attract many downloads from humans, but it should have enough keywords and tests to be attractive to bots.
